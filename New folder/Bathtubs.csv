					Cinema screen or computer monitor, fridge or milk carton, a room, a table, this brochure: our world is inconceivable without the rectangle. Perhaps this is why we are so attracted to Vero: the forms of this ceramic range are entirely restricted to the rectangle. It’s a restriction that gives rise to new possibilities: this is because Vero is one of the most versatile ceramic ranges of all time. With minimalist design at its core and the strong support of Duravit’s ceramic tradition and expertise, Vero is impressive in terms of its form, function and quality.

The more water, the more room, the more depth…the better. With its square body and circular tub and an immersion depth of 510 mm, the elegant Blue Moon tub embodies design in its purest form. Immerse yourself completely in water coloured with light. Because only the user’s back touches the tub, a feeling of pleasant floating weightlessness takes over – and this becomes even more pronounced in the larger version of Blue Moon.

Comfort is the driving force behind the unusual design of the Paiova bathtub: its trapezoidal shape offers space for two people to lie side by side. Bathtub panelling in American Walnut (real wood veneer). It’s even more comfortable with the optional neckrest. The step that matches the bathtub panelling in American Cherry (real wood veneer) makes it easier to get in and out. Practical companion: the spacious mobile storage unit. The optional handle on the rim of the bathtub serves as an additional entry support.

An understated ambience creates a sense of serenity, giving one a moment to breathe deep and relax. Like DuraStyle: designed by Matteo Thun & Partners, the bathroom series is deliberately understated – and therefore able to blend harmoniously into any environment. It is its simplicity of form that makes DuraStyle so unique: a narrow, elegant ceramic edge and the mixture of open and closed furniture units with different decor finishes and real wood for the furniture accessories defines that individuality. With Design, variety and an attractive price / performance ratio Durastyle sets a new standard in the bathroom, in the Home as well as in the Project area.

Since 1817, Duravit has proudly manufactured the industry standard in plumbing fixtures. Today, Duravit soaking bathtubs bring an elegance to bathrooms that few other bathtubs can match. All made of durable sanitary acrylic and coated with a crisp White Alpin finish, Duravit soaking bathtubs are as much a functional investment as they are a sophisticated focal point. These deep, luxurious baths allow for full immersion in the water, making Duravit soaking bathtubs a desirable addition to any home.
An understated ambience creates a sense of serenity, giving one a moment to breathe deep and relax. Like DuraStyle: designed by Matteo Thun & Partners, the bathroom series is deliberately understated – and therefore able to blend harmoniously into any environment. It is its simplicity of form that makes DuraStyle so unique: a narrow, elegant ceramic edge and the mixture of open and closed furniture units with different decor finishes and real wood for the furniture accessories defines that individuality. With Design, variety and an attractive price / performance ratio Durastyle sets a new standard in the bathroom, in the Home as well as in the Project area.

							With its clean-cut architectural design, Happy D. has written bathroom history. The updated Happy D.2 is a complete bathroom solution that is just as chic, versatile and timelessly modern as its predecessor – and yet it’s also completely new. The washbasin is available as a furniture washbasin with matching vanity unit or with a metal console, as a surface-mounted washbasin and as a classic washbasin with pedestal or siphon cover. One of the basins, which features a curved rear rim, appears to float gently in its surroundings – creating the sense of weightlessness that translates throughout the series. Happy D.2 brings a new feminine chic to the bathroom.

		Cape Cod, located in New England off the coast of the US, features an unforgettable flair. The region, known for its beaches stretching for miles, crystal clear water and untamed nature, is the inspiration for Cape Cod, the new bathroom series by Philippe Starck and Duravit.
		Cape Cod eliminates all barriers between the in- and outdoors, making nature a permanent component of the bathroom, with organic forms and authentic materials such as solid real wood and warm ceramics. With Cape Cod, Starck and Duravit have reinvented the bathroom as a place of rejuvenation for the mind, body and soul. Cape Cod combines originality of design with timeless modernity by offering a sleek, thin ceramic washbowl rim, an impressive mixture of furniture materials and an organically shaped bathtub.
Spectacular bathtub with luxurious detail... Spectacular: the organic curves and the amazingly thin tub rim of the free standing Cape Cod bathtub. A particularly luxurious detail is the integrated headrest on the tub’s back slope.
Thin bathtub rims, organic forms and gentle integrated curves. Just like the washbowl and the bathroom furniture, the Cape Cod bathtub fuses material and form, creating innovative unity. Thanks to the new Duravit material DuraSolid, the smallest details of Starck’s design were realized: stunningly thin bathtub rims, organic forms and gentle integrated curves. From the monolithic design to the integrated headrest, Cape Cod offers a continuous satin-finished surface that is also pleasant to the touch.
Architectural simplicity of design. The architectural simplicity of the design is retained in the free standing bathtub as well as the back-to-wall and left or right corner versions.

Washroom hygiene is the result of visual appeal and practicality. Developed by Prof. Frank Huster, the Architec ceramic range is compliant with philosophy. The circle and square: two basic architectural elements that sufficed in creating a straight-lined, modern, abundant product range for almost any intended use, whether private, public or barrier-free. The unusual diagonal cut of the Architec washbasin allows not only a generous storage surface but also more space in a smaller area.

		Cape Cod, located in New England off the coast of the US, features an unforgettable flair. The region, known for its beaches stretching for miles, crystal clear water and untamed nature, is the inspiration for Cape Cod, the new bathroom series by Philippe Starck and Duravit.
		Cape Cod eliminates all barriers between the in- and outdoors, making nature a permanent component of the bathroom, with organic forms and authentic materials such as solid real wood and warm ceramics. With Cape Cod, Starck and Duravit have reinvented the bathroom as a place of rejuvenation for the mind, body and soul. Cape Cod combines originality of design with timeless modernity by offering a sleek, thin ceramic washbowl rim, an impressive mixture of furniture materials and an organically shaped bathtub.
Spectacular bathtub with luxurious detail... Spectacular: the organic curves and the amazingly thin tub rim of the free standing Cape Cod bathtub. A particularly luxurious detail is the integrated headrest on the tub’s back slope.
Thin bathtub rims, organic forms and gentle integrated curves. Just like the washbowl and the bathroom furniture, the Cape Cod bathtub fuses material and form, creating innovative unity. Thanks to the new Duravit material DuraSolid, the smallest details of Starck’s design were realized: stunningly thin bathtub rims, organic forms and gentle integrated curves. From the monolithic design to the integrated headrest, Cape Cod offers a continuous satin-finished surface that is also pleasant to the touch.
Architectural simplicity of design. The architectural simplicity of the design is retained in the free standing bathtub as well as the back-to-wall and left or right corner versions.

Since 1817, Duravit has proudly manufactured the industry standard in plumbing fixtures. Today, Duravit soaking bathtubs bring an elegance to bathrooms that few other bathtubs can match. All made of durable sanitary acrylic and coated with a crisp White Alpin finish, Duravit soaking bathtubs are as much a functional investment as they are a sophisticated focal point. These deep, luxurious baths allow for full immersion in the water, making Duravit soaking bathtubs a desirable addition to any home.
Comfort is the driving force behind the unusual design of the Paiova bathtub: its trapezoidal shape offers space for two people to lie side by side. Bathtub panelling in American Walnut (real wood veneer). It’s even more comfortable with the optional neckrest. The step that matches the bathtub panelling in American Cherry (real wood veneer) makes it easier to get in and out. Practical companion: the spacious mobile storage unit. The optional handle on the rim of the bathtub serves as an additional entry support.
						Advanced acrylic technology enabled to cut the signature trapezoidal form of this model out of a rectangular monobloc. Instead of a bathtub with panelling and rim, the Paiova Monolith is provided with an apron leading all the way down to the floor, resulting in a seamless piece of mono-materiality. The calm exuded by the material contrasts with the vitality inherent in the geometry. A new visual quality arises, accompanied by plenty of additional space for bathroom items and tap fittings.

Since 1817, Duravit has proudly manufactured the industry standard in plumbing fixtures. Today, Duravit soaking bathtubs bring an elegance to bathrooms that few other bathtubs can match. All made of durable sanitary acrylic and coated with a crisp White Alpin finish, Duravit soaking bathtubs are as much a functional investment as they are a sophisticated focal point. These deep, luxurious baths allow for full immersion in the water, making Duravit soaking bathtubs a desirable addition to any home.
Comfort is the driving force behind the unusual design of the Paiova bathtub: its trapezoidal shape offers space for two people to lie side by side. Bathtub panelling in American Walnut (real wood veneer). It’s even more comfortable with the optional neckrest. The step that matches the bathtub panelling in American Cherry (real wood veneer) makes it easier to get in and out. Practical companion: the spacious mobile storage unit. The optional handle on the rim of the bathtub serves as an additional entry support.
						Advanced acrylic technology enabled to cut the signature trapezoidal form of this model out of a rectangular monobloc. Instead of a bathtub with panelling and rim, the Paiova Monolith is provided with an apron leading all the way down to the floor, resulting in a seamless piece of mono-materiality. The calm exuded by the material contrasts with the vitality inherent in the geometry. A new visual quality arises, accompanied by plenty of additional space for bathroom items and tap fittings.
