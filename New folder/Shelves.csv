In 1956, production evolved from earthenware to porcelain, extending the product range to include sanitary ceramics. This provided a platform for future success and also introduced the sanitary world to a new name: Duravit. Today, Duravit AG operates at an international level and boasts 10 production plants with a workforce of more than 5,000 employees worldwide."
