Tranquillity. Clarity. Space for contemplation.
	This is how designer Christian Werner describes the vision that gave rise to L-Cube – a bathroom furniture program that eliminates all unnecessary elements to achieve the ultimate in simplistic beauty. With fewer “distractions”, the bathroom user is inspired to truly relax and unwind. The geometry of the sleek, rectangular furniture fronts remain uninterrupted by hardware.
Unique Details:
						Unique features can be found in the details, like the shadow gap between the countertop and the vanity units and the subdivision of the drawer fronts. Minimal design elements create maximum elegance and turn L-Cube into the connecting element between the bathroom itself and the elements within, transforming it into a “platform” for sanitary ceramics, tap fittings and accessories.

Tranquillity. Clarity. Space for contemplation.
	This is how designer Christian Werner describes the vision that gave rise to L-Cube – a bathroom furniture program that eliminates all unnecessary elements to achieve the ultimate in simplistic beauty. With fewer “distractions”, the bathroom user is inspired to truly relax and unwind. The geometry of the sleek, rectangular furniture fronts remain uninterrupted by hardware.
Unique Details:
						Unique features can be found in the details, like the shadow gap between the countertop and the vanity units and the subdivision of the drawer fronts. Minimal design elements create maximum elegance and turn L-Cube into the connecting element between the bathroom itself and the elements within, transforming it into a “platform” for sanitary ceramics, tap fittings and accessories.

In 1956, production evolved from earthenware to porcelain, extending the product range to include sanitary ceramics. This provided a platform for future success and also introduced the sanitary world to a new name: Duravit. Today, Duravit AG operates at an international level and boasts 10 production plants with a workforce of more than 5,000 employees worldwide."
