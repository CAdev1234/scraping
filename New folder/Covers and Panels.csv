An understated ambience creates a sense of serenity, giving one a moment to breathe deep and relax. Like DuraStyle: designed by Matteo Thun & Partners, the bathroom series is deliberately understated – and therefore able to blend harmoniously into any environment. It is its simplicity of form that makes DuraStyle so unique: a narrow, elegant ceramic edge and the mixture of open and closed furniture units with different decor finishes and real wood for the furniture accessories defines that individuality. With Design, variety and an attractive price / performance ratio Durastyle sets a new standard in the bathroom, in the Home as well as in the Project area.

An understated ambience creates a sense of serenity, giving one a moment to breathe deep and relax. Like DuraStyle: designed by Matteo Thun & Partners, the bathroom series is deliberately understated – and therefore able to blend harmoniously into any environment. It is its simplicity of form that makes DuraStyle so unique: a narrow, elegant ceramic edge and the mixture of open and closed furniture units with different decor finishes and real wood for the furniture accessories defines that individuality. With Design, variety and an attractive price / performance ratio Durastyle sets a new standard in the bathroom, in the Home as well as in the Project area. 
Please note, that this is a bathtub panel only. BATHTUB NOT INLUDED.
