	Duravit has been the proud recipient of numerous international design awards. These awards celebrate bold design, which has become Duravit’s hallmark over the years.Each Duravit designer is a specialist in his field – a prominent global innovator with an inherent sense for good design. Good design, as Duravit and its designers see it, is never at the expense of practicality – neither is interested in “design for design’s sake”.That’s you, the bathroom user, and your own set of needs and requirements. Thanks to an ongoing dialogue with its trade partners and sanitary ware dealers, Duravit is best able to address these needs and requirements in the brand’s designs. Simply put, Duravit recognizes good bathroom design by the fact that it seems specially-created to suit all individual tastes.This fusion of Duravit’s environmentally-friendly production technologies with the company’s meticulous quality control results in products that are highly functional and long-lasting.At Duravit, sustainable materials, modern expertise and the foresight to recognize what will be important tomorrow comprise the essential ingredients for beautiful – and responsible – living bathrooms.
	Not only in its literal sense, but also in terms of the French word “conforter” – to strengthen. As design satisfies very fundamental human requirements for appearance and functionality, it also demands to be experienced by all the senses. It is to be seen, touched and used - to address and build the user's emotions and personality. P3 Comforts satisfies these needs, and does so with a clean and effortless design.

Collection Highlights:The handles and feet of the designer range are available in Chrome and in the color of the furniture body for seven finishes. for all wooden decors, handles & feet are only available in Chrome. Floorstanding variants underline Brioso's balanced proportions.Alternatively, handles and feet are also available in Chrome.These stand in elegant contrast to the colored furniture finish.A total of 15 finishes are available in various decors including new, on-trend tones such as Matt Light Blue and Matt Concrete Gray.The consoles of the Universal Console program are available in two different thicknesses, with variable widths and two depths. a perfect match: Brioso vanity units and low cabinets.As a stylish solution for the washing area, the Vero Air washbasin is also available as a c-bonded version in conjunction with the Brioso vanity unit. In a complex and patented process, the furniture washbasin is connected almost seamlessly to the vanity unit.The tall cabinet and semi-tall cabinet from the Brioso range provide extra storage space in the bathroom.Washbasin downlight, dimmer function, and mirror de-fogger have a contact-free control.The cabinet trims fitted to the sides can be ordered to match the color of the finish and round off the fresh overall effect of the range.The Brioso furniture has presence whilst still being reserved. Yet another reason why Brioso can be so easily combined with designer ranges such as Vero Air, P3 Comforts, ME by Starck, Starck 3, and D-Code.

Good design, as Duravit and its designers see it, is never at the expense of practicality – neither is interested in “design for design’s sake”.That’s you, the bathroom user, and your own set of needs and requirements. Thanks to an ongoing dialogue with its trade partners and sanitary ware dealers, Duravit is best able to address these needs and requirements in the brand’s designs. Simply put, Duravit recognizes good bathroom design by the fact that it seems specially-created to suit all individual tastes.This fusion of Duravit’s environmentally-friendly production technologies with the company’s meticulous quality control results in products that are highly functional and long-lasting.At Duravit, sustainable materials, modern expertise and the foresight to recognize what will be important tomorrow comprise the essential ingredients for beautiful – and responsible – living bathrooms.
	Duravit has worked with designer Christian Werner to design a furniture series that represents airiness, freshness and joie de vivre in today’s bathroom.The Range stands out with its precise, finely nuanced geometry which is produced by slender cabinet frames that form the edges of the furniture, mirrors, and mirror cabinets.
Collection Highlights:
		The handles and feet of the designer range are available in Chrome and in the color of the furniture body for seven finishes. for all wooden decors, handles & feet are only available in Chrome. Floorstanding variants underline Brioso's balanced proportions.
		Alternatively, handles and feet are also available in Chrome.These stand in elegant contrast to the colored furniture finish.
		A total of 15 finishes are available in various decors including new, on-trend tones such as Matt Light Blue and Matt Concrete Gray.
		The consoles of the Universal Console program are available in two different thicknesses, with variable widths and two depths. a perfect match: Brioso vanity units and low cabinets.
		As a stylish solution for the washing area, the Vero Air washbasin is also available as a c-bonded version in conjunction with the Brioso vanity unit. In a complex and patented process, the furniture washbasin is connected almost seamlessly to the vanity unit.
		The tall cabinet and semi-tall cabinet from the Brioso range provide extra storage space in the bathroom.
		Washbasin downlight, dimmer function, and mirror de-fogger have a contact-free control.The cabinet trims fitted to the sides can be ordered to match the color of the finish and round off the fresh overall effect of the range.
		The Brioso furniture has presence whilst still being reserved. Yet another reason why Brioso can be so easily combined with designer ranges such as Vero Air, P3 Comforts, ME by Starck, Starck 3, and D-Code.

Because the series presents itself from a feminine side: this is achieved thanks to the fine radii of the rounded corners that feature throughout the bathroom program – and that give Happy D.2 its distinctive, archetypal design. No doubt about it, Happy D.2 brings a new elegance into the bathroom.The washbasin is available as furniture washbasin with matching vanity unit or metal console, in an above-counter version or as classic washbasin in combination with pedestal or siphon cover.The basin seems to lift visually from the wall, creating an almost floating effect – and this sense of weightlessness features throughout the series.
