Tranquillity. Clarity. Space for contemplation.

With fewer “distractions”, the bathroom user is inspired to truly relax and unwind. The geometry of the sleek, rectangular furniture fronts remain uninterrupted by hardware.

The clever mirror features a “frame of light”, which can be turned on and off with a simple hand motion.

	The simple, natural, fundamental elements of life. With his Starck 1 range, he achieved just that… and almost immediately wrote bathroom history. With Starck 1, Philippe Starck and Duravit have returned to the beginnings of hygiene, body care and wellness in addition to the evolution of the bathroom. The Starck 1 toilet, bathtub and washbasin are unmistakable descendents of their historic predecessors – the bucket, tub and washbowl – even though they have been completely reinterpreted. It’s great to know that something good doesn’t have to be “optimized”: since their market launch in 1994, all products in the range – ceramic, furniture, tubs, accessories – have been meticulously crafted by hand using the same methods. This quality is nothing less than you would expect from a modern classic like Starck 1.
	Another wonder creation from designer Philipe Starck, this mirror is sure to stun and please. Duravits fascinating fixture is the latest style statement in both classic and modern households. Loaded with latest hi-tech features the mirror is quite user-friendly and provides the much-needed refreshing ambience in your bathroom. Provided with sensor switch and complete with LED light, this IP44 rated mirror is a must-buy.
	The elegant, skilfully designed mirror (43 1/2"" x 30 1/8""), integrates perfectly within the range. The all-round LED lighting creates perfect illumination and a pleasant lighting atmosphere in the bathroom.
