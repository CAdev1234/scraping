With alternatives and solutions for all imaginable bathroom situations, D-Code is a bathroom range that many people have been waiting for – including you perhaps.

Cinema screen or computer monitor, fridge or milk carton, a room, a table, this brochure: our world is inconceivable without the rectangle. Perhaps this is why we are so attracted to Vero: the forms of this ceramic range are entirely restricted to the rectangle. It’s a restriction that gives rise to new possibilities: this is because Vero is one of the most versatile ceramic ranges of all time. With minimalist design at its core and the strong support of Duravit’s ceramic tradition and expertise, Vero is impressive in terms of its form, function and quality.

A true Starck, but less elaborate: this was the inspiration behind the second Duravit – Philippe Starck collaboration. The result: Starck 2, a range of ceramics that is the ultimate successor to its famous predecessor, Starck 1. Starck 2 also derives its inspiration from the origins of bathroom design: the ceramic forms embody the flowing movement of water and allow us to see the bathroom through a new set of eyes. Starck 2 – the bathroom as a source.

	However, Individuality does Not Mean Making an Impression with All Means. Simply an Ambiance which Reflects Itself, Gives Your Personality Air to Breathe and Space to do Your Own Thing. Such as Durastyle: Designed by Matteo Thun & Partners, the Range of Bathrooms is Revealed as Deliberately Discreet – and Blends Harmoniously Into Practically Any Ambiance for This Very Same Reason.
	The Innovative Impression Given Continues Within the Design of Toilet and Bidet: the Flat Seat & Cover, Available with and Without a Soft-Close System, is Eye-Catching. Wall-Mounted and Freestanding Toilets can also be Combined with the Shower-Toilet Seat Sensowash Durastyle by Starck. Ceramics and Seat Blend Into a Harmonious, Elegant Unit.The Open Design of the Flushing Rim Enables an Innovative Water Flow. Thanks to Modern 4.5-L Technology, Perfect Flushing Results are Guaranteed, even with Only a Small Amount of Water. Due to Its Open and Easily Accessible Rim Area, It is also Considerably Easier to Keep the Bowl Clean.
