	A True Starck, But Less Elaborate: This Was the Inspiration Behind the Second Duravit – Philippe Starck Collaboration.The Result: Starck 2, a Range of Ceramics that is the Ultimate Successor to Its Famous Predecessor, Starck 1. Starck 2 also Derives Its Inspiration From the Origins of Bathroom Design: the Ceramic Forms Embody the Flowing Movement of Water and Allow Us to See the Bathroom Through a New Set of Eyes. Starck 2 – the Bathroom as a Source.
	The Sides of the Starck 2 Toilet are Completely Closed, with No Fastenings – Seamless Perfection, a Feast for Design Lovers.The Toilet is Available as a Wall-Mounted Version, Floorstanding Version for In-Wall Cistern with Matching Bidet, Floorstanding Version with Visible Cistern and with the Shower-Toilet Seat Sensowash Starck.

Frequently copied but never matched. The Starck 3 range is and remains the measure of all things when it comes to design, variety and price. Even more top-quality Starck at a great value: there’s no doubt that, with the Starck 3 range of ceramics, Duravit has revolutionized the sanitary world. Starck 3 brings design to a segment where it was once an untouched concept with a vast array of products that meet all needs and tastes. And – the range provides better value for money than ever before. With more than 50 models and 64 variants, Starck 3 is one of Duravit’s most extensive bathroom ranges. So, it only seems right that a range that offers so much requires its own brochure to illustrate its numerous applications, examples, and references.

Additional Information:
HygieneGlaze - HygieneGlaze is not a surface coating. It is integrated into the ceramic glaze and then baked into the ceramic during firing, providing continuous protection with long-lasting effectiveness. Tests by the Institute for Hygiene and Public Health at the University of Bonn confirm that HygieneGlaze kills an almost unprecedented 99.9 % of germs. Antibacterial, durable, safe: with HygieneGlaze Duravit defines a new standard in bathroom hygiene. HygieneGlaze is optionally available for the toilets and urinals in the P3 Comforts and ME by Starck collections.

Even more top-quality Starck at a great value: there’s no doubt that, with the Starck 3 range of ceramics, Duravit has revolutionized the sanitary world. Starck 3 brings design to a segment where it was once an untouched concept with a vast array of products that meet all needs and tastes. And – the range provides better value for money than ever before. With more than 50 models and 64 variants, Starck 3 is one of Duravit’s most extensive bathroom ranges. So, it only seems right that a range that offers so much requires its own brochure to illustrate its numerous applications, examples, and references.

Frequently copied but never matched. The Starck 3 range is and remains the measure of all things when it comes to design, variety and price. Even more top-quality Starck at a great value: there’s no doubt that, with the Starck 3 range of ceramics, Duravit has revolutionized the sanitary world. Starck 3 brings design to a segment where it was once an untouched concept with a vast array of products that meet all needs and tastes. And – the range provides better value for money than ever before. With more than 50 models and 64 variants, Starck 3 is one of Duravit’s most extensive bathroom ranges. So, it only seems right that a range that offers so much requires its own brochure to illustrate its numerous applications, examples, and references.

These awards celebrate bold design, which has become Duravit’s hallmark over the years.Each Duravit designer is a specialist in his field – a prominent global innovator with an inherent sense for good design.

Thanks to an ongoing dialogue with its trade partners and sanitary ware dealers, Duravit is best able to address these needs and requirements in the brand’s designs. Simply put, Duravit recognizes good bathroom design by the fact that it seems specially-created to suit all individual tastes.This fusion of Duravit’s environmentally-friendly production technologies with the company’s meticulous quality control results in products that are highly functional and long-lasting.At Duravit, sustainable materials, modern expertise and the foresight to recognize what will be important tomorrow comprise the essential ingredients for beautiful – and responsible – living bathrooms.

	Duravit has been the proud recipient of numerous international design awards. These awards celebrate bold design, which has become Duravit’s hallmark over the years.Each Duravit designer is a specialist in his field – a prominent global innovator with an inherent sense for good design. Good design, as Duravit and its designers see it, is never at the expense of practicality – neither is interested in “design for design’s sake”.That’s you, the bathroom user, and your own set of needs and requirements. Thanks to an ongoing dialogue with its trade partners and sanitary ware dealers, Duravit is best able to address these needs and requirements in the brand’s designs. Simply put, Duravit recognizes good bathroom design by the fact that it seems specially-created to suit all individual tastes.This fusion of Duravit’s environmentally-friendly production technologies with the company’s meticulous quality control results in products that are highly functional and long-lasting.At Duravit, sustainable materials, modern expertise and the foresight to recognize what will be important tomorrow comprise the essential ingredients for beautiful – and responsible – living bathrooms.
	However, individuality does not mean making an impression with all means. Simply an ambiance which reflects itself, gives your personality air to breathe and space to do your own thing. Such as DuraStyle: Designed by Matteo Thun & Partners, the range of bathrooms is revealed as deliberately discreet – and blends harmoniously into practically any ambiance for this very same reason.
	The innovative impression given continues within the design of toilet and bidet: The flat seat & cover, available with and without a soft-close system, is eye-catching. Wall-mounted and freestanding toilets can also be combined with the shower-toilet seat SensoWash® DuraStyle by Starck. Ceramics and seat blend into a harmonious, elegant unit.The open design of the flushing rim enables an innovative water flow. Thanks to modern 4.5-l technology, perfect flushing results are guaranteed, even with only a small amount of water. Due to its open and easily accessible rim area, it is also considerably easier to keep the bowl clean.

	Duravit has been the proud recipient of numerous international design awards. These awards celebrate bold design, which has become Duravit’s hallmark over the years.Each Duravit designer is a specialist in his field – a prominent global innovator with an inherent sense for good design. Good design, as Duravit and its designers see it, is never at the expense of practicality – neither is interested in “design for design’s sake”.That’s you, the bathroom user, and your own set of needs and requirements. Thanks to an ongoing dialogue with its trade partners and sanitary ware dealers, Duravit is best able to address these needs and requirements in the brand’s designs. Simply put, Duravit recognizes good bathroom design by the fact that it seems specially-created to suit all individual tastes.This fusion of Duravit’s environmentally-friendly production technologies with the company’s meticulous quality control results in products that are highly functional and long-lasting.At Duravit, sustainable materials, modern expertise and the foresight to recognize what will be important tomorrow comprise the essential ingredients for beautiful – and responsible – living bathrooms.
	Happy D.2 is a complete bathroom solution that is just as chic, versatile and timelessly modern as its predecessor – and yet it’s also completely new. Because the series presents itself from a feminine side: this is achieved thanks to the fine radii of the rounded corners that feature throughout the bathroom program – and that give Happy D.2 its distinctive, archetypal design. No
	doubt about it, Happy D.2 brings a new elegance into the bathroom.
	Form and utility: toilets and bidets are available as wall-mounted, floor standing and back-to-wall options, both with and without the SoftClose seat function. The toilets can also be combined with the SensoWash® Starck shower-toilet seat.

Products that appear perfectly proportioned from every angle and can simultaneously fulfill individual ideas. ME by Starck is the result and the framework for your own personal style, whether it be pure, elegant, natural, or completely individualistic.
	The ME by Starck bathroom range, designed for Duravit by the renowned Philippe Starck, is known for its streamlined aesthetic and countless design combinations. With the new ADA compliant configuration, ME by Starck will advance the goal of the entire collection: to offer individualized solutions for any and every bathroom, with design and diversity in mind.
	The ME by Starck One-Piece toilet combines the collection’s signature slim edge with a widely-appealing, modern design. Duravit's innovative Rimless® flush technology ensures a dynamic and powerful flow of water that rinses the entire inner surface, while allowing for efficient and hygienic maintenance. Duravit developed technology to reduce the weight of the toilets, resulting in sleek, self-contained components that do not require attachment niches on the sides. Following ADA compliant adjustments, the ME by Starck one-piece will be available in a higher toilet seat height (17 3/8”) with the option of a left or right side lever for flush control.Now, ME by Starck is also available in White Satin Matte. The toilets are available White (glossy) inside and White Satin Matte on the outside, to guarantee optimum hygiene.

	Not only in its literal sense, but also in terms of the French word “conforter” – to strengthen. As design satisfies very fundamental human requirements for appearance and functionality, it also demands to be experienced by all the senses.
