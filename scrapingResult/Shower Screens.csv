<strong>Shower Screen OpenSpace B</strong><br/>
	The shower enclosure that enlarges the bathroom. Instead of taking up valuable space, it can simply be folded back against the wall after each use. Duravit and the EOOS design group have taken this innovative idea to the next level with OpenSpace B, which opens up even more possibilities. Thanks to a new mounting bracket, no additional diagonal wall support is required, even in larger applications.</div>

In 1956, production evolved from earthenware to porcelain, extending the product range to include sanitary ceramics. This provided a platform for future success and also introduced the sanitary world to a new name: Duravit. Today, Duravit AG operates at an international level and boasts 10 production plants with a workforce of more than 5,000 employees worldwide."
