Tranquillity. Clarity. Space for contemplation.
	This is how designer Christian Werner describes the vision that gave rise to L-Cube – a bathroom furniture program that eliminates all unnecessary elements to achieve the ultimate in simplistic beauty. With fewer “distractions”, the bathroom user is inspired to truly relax and unwind. The geometry of the sleek, rectangular furniture fronts remain uninterrupted by hardware.
Unique Details:
						Unique features can be found in the details, like the shadow gap between the countertop and the vanity units and the subdivision of the drawer fronts. Minimal design elements create maximum elegance and turn L-Cube into the connecting element between the bathroom itself and the elements within, transforming it into a “platform” for sanitary ceramics, tap fittings and accessories.

	As modern life places greater demands upon us, we, in turn, also start to demand more. These demands also extend to the bathroom, which we expect to be attractive, inviting and also functional.

The characteristic, ergonomic handles feature throughout the range and give Ketho its true originality. The reduced look of the range is fl exible enough to suit any modern bathroom ambience. Combined with good value for money, Ketho becomes the ideal range for first-time buyers.

	As modern life places greater demands upon us, we, in turn, also start to demand more. These demands also extend to the bathroom, which we expect to be attractive, inviting and also functional. Ketho takes this development into account: designed by Christian Werner, the new range of bathroom furniture is characterised by clear forms, well thought-out functionality and comfortable quality. The characteristic, ergonomic handles feature throughout the range and give Ketho its true originality. The reduced look of the range is fl exible enough to suit any modern bathroom ambience. Combined with good value for money, Ketho becomes the ideal range for first-time buyers.

all began in Hornberg, Germany in 1817 when Georg Friedrich Horn built an earthenware factory initially focused solely on the manufacture of crockery. In 1956, production evolved from earthenware to porcelain, extending the product range to include sanitary ceramics. This provided a platform for future success and also introduced the sanitary world to a new name: Duravit. Today, Duravit AG operates at an international level and boasts 10 production plants with a workforce of more than 5,000 employees worldwide."

In 1956, production evolved from earthenware to porcelain, extending the product range to include sanitary ceramics. This provided a platform for future success and also introduced the sanitary world to a new name: Duravit. Today, Duravit AG operates at an international level and boasts 10 production plants with a workforce of more than 5,000 employees worldwide."
