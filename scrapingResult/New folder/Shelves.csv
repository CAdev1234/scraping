	An understated ambience creates a sense of serenity, giving one a moment to breathe deep and relax. Like DuraStyle: designed by Matteo Thun & Partners, the bathroom series is deliberately understated – and therefore able to blend harmoniously into any environment. It is its simplicity of form that makes DuraStyle so unique: a narrow, elegant ceramic edge and the mixture of open and closed furniture units with different decor finishes and real wood for the furniture accessories defines that individuality. With Design, variety and an attractive price/performance ratio Durastyle sets a new standard in the bathroom, in the Home as well as in the Project area.

Individuality is important in everyday living.
However, individuality does not mean making an impression with all means. Simply an ambiance which reflects itself, gives your personality air to breathe and space to do your own thing. Such as DuraStyle: Designed by Matteo Thun & Partners, the range of bathrooms is revealed as deliberately discreet – and blends harmoniously into practically any ambiance for this very same reason.
Simple and Clever.
Simplicity also rules in the bathroom furniture area. The trick is in the mix between open and closed areas: In this way, everything works airily and transparently. The refined 2/3 division of the wall unit is also continued with the vanity units. The mirror is available in four widths and the satin-finish LED panel provides ideal illumination with up to 300 lux.

Individuality is important in everyday living.
However, individuality does not mean making an impression with all means. Simply an ambiance which reflects itself, gives your personality air to breathe and space to do your own thing. Such as DuraStyle: Designed by Matteo Thun & Partners, the range of bathrooms is revealed as deliberately discreet – and blends harmoniously into practically any ambiance for this very same reason.
Simple and Clever.
Simplicity also rules in the bathroom furniture area. The trick is in the mix between open and closed areas: In this way, everything works airily and transparently. The refined 2/3 division of the wall unit is also continued with the vanity units. The mirror is available in four widths and the satin-finish LED panel provides ideal illumination with up to 300 lux.

Individuality is important in everyday living.
However, individuality does not mean making an impression with all means. Simply an ambiance which reflects itself, gives your personality air to breathe and space to do your own thing. Such as DuraStyle: Designed by Matteo Thun & Partners, the range of bathrooms is revealed as deliberately discreet – and blends harmoniously into practically any ambiance for this very same reason.
Simple and Clever.
Simplicity also rules in the bathroom furniture area. The trick is in the mix between open and closed areas: In this way, everything works airily and transparently. The refined 2/3 division of the wall unit is also continued with the vanity units. The mirror is available in four widths and the satin-finish LED panel provides ideal illumination with up to 300 lux.
Collection Features:
Simple, yet formal design
Design by Matteo Thun and Partners
Price-conscious, versatile, perfect for any taste
Furniture solutions with a distinct lightness
A mix of open and closed fronts
Exciting combinations: light and dark decor wood tones
Doors and drawers without handles

	An understated ambience creates a sense of serenity, giving one a moment to breathe deep and relax. Like DuraStyle: designed by Matteo Thun & Partners, the bathroom series is deliberately understated – and therefore able to blend harmoniously into any environment. It is its simplicity of form that makes DuraStyle so unique: a narrow, elegant ceramic edge and the mixture of open and closed furniture units with different decor finishes and real wood for the furniture accessories defines that individuality. With Design, variety and an attractive price/performance ratio Durastyle sets a new standard in the bathroom, in the Home as well as in the Project area.

Individuality is important in everyday living.
However, individuality does not mean making an impression with all means. Simply an ambiance which reflects itself, gives your personality air to breathe and space to do your own thing. Such as DuraStyle: Designed by Matteo Thun & Partners, the range of bathrooms is revealed as deliberately discreet – and blends harmoniously into practically any ambiance for this very same reason.
Simple and Clever.
Simplicity also rules in the bathroom furniture area. The trick is in the mix between open and closed areas: In this way, everything works airily and transparently. The refined 2/3 division of the wall unit is also continued with the vanity units. The mirror is available in four widths and the satin-finish LED panel provides ideal illumination with up to 300 lux.

Individuality is important in everyday living.
However, individuality does not mean making an impression with all means. Simply an ambiance which reflects itself, gives your personality air to breathe and space to do your own thing. Such as DuraStyle: Designed by Matteo Thun & Partners, the range of bathrooms is revealed as deliberately discreet – and blends harmoniously into practically any ambiance for this very same reason.
Simple and Clever.
Simplicity also rules in the bathroom furniture area. The trick is in the mix between open and closed areas: In this way, everything works airily and transparently. The refined 2/3 division of the wall unit is also continued with the vanity units. The mirror is available in four widths and the satin-finish LED panel provides ideal illumination with up to 300 lux.
Collection Features:
Simple, yet formal design
Design by Matteo Thun and Partners
Price-conscious, versatile, perfect for any taste
Furniture solutions with a distinct lightness
A mix of open and closed fronts
Exciting combinations: light and dark decor wood tones

	Duravit has been the Proud Recipient of numerous international design awards.These awards celebrate bold design, which has become Duravit’s hallmark over the years.Each Duravit designer is a specialist in his field – a prominent global innovator with an inherent sense for good design. Good design, as Duravit and its designers see it, is never at the expense of practicality – neither is interested in “design for design’s sake”.That’s you, the bathroom user, and your own set of needs and requirements. Thanks to an ongoing dialogue with its trade partners and sanitary ware dealers, Duravit is best able to address these needs and requirements in the brand’s designs. Simply put, Duravit recognizes good bathroom design by the fact that it seems specially-created to suit all individual tastes.This fusion of Duravit’s environmentally-friendly production technologies with the company’s meticulous quality control results in products that are highly functional and long-lasting.At Duravit, sustainable materials, modern expertise and the foresight to recognize what will be important tomorrow comprise the essential ingredients for beautiful – and responsible – living bathrooms.
	This is how designer Christian Werner describes the vision that gave rise to L-Cube – a bathroom furniture program that eliminates all unnecessary elements to achieve the ultimate in simplistic beauty. With fewer “distractions”, the bathroom user is inspired to truly relax and unwind.The geometry of the sleek, rectangular furniture fronts remain uninterrupted by hardware.
	The practical open shelves vary in length and configuration, and can be mounted either horizontally or vertically. Alternating open and closed elements create “furniture collages” that are as unconventional as they are attractive. It is, of course, also possible to combine a range of surfaces to create a true statement piece.

	Cinema screen or computer monitor, fridge or milk carton, a room, a table, this brochure: our world is inconceivable without the rectangle. Perhaps this is why we are so attracted to Vero: the forms of this ceramic range are entirely restricted to the rectangle. It’s a restriction that gives rise to new possibilities: this is because Vero is one of the most versatile ceramic ranges of all time. With minimalist design at its core and the strong support of Duravit’s ceramic tradition and expertise, Vero is impressive in terms of its form, function and quality.

In 1956, production evolved from earthenware to porcelain, extending the product range to include sanitary ceramics. This provided a platform for future success and also introduced the sanitary world to a new name: Duravit. Today, Duravit AG operates at an international level and boasts 10 production plants with a workforce of more than 5,000 employees worldwide."
