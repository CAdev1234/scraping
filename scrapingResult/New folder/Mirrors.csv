<p>
	Duravit has been the Proud Recipient of Numerous International Design Awards.These Awards Celebrate Bold Design, which has Become Duravit’s Hallmark over the Years.Each Duravit Designer is a Specialist in His Field – a Prominent Global Innovator with an Inherent Sense for Good Design. Good Design, as Duravit and Its Designers See It, is never at the Expense of Practicality – Neither is Interested in “Design for Design’s Sake”.That’s You, the Bathroom User, and Your Own Set of Needs and Requirements. Thanks to an Ongoing Dialogue with Its Trade Partners and Sanitary Ware Dealers, Duravit is Best Able to Address these Needs and Requirements in the Brand’s Designs. Simply Put, Duravit Recognizes Good Bathroom Design by the Fact that It Seems Specially-Created to Suit All Individual Tastes.This Fusion of Duravit’s Environmentally-Friendly Production Technologies with the Company’s Meticulous Quality Control Results in Products that are Highly Functional and Long-Lasting.At Duravit, Sustainable Materials, Modern Expertise and the Foresight to Recognize What Will be Important Tomorrow Comprise the Essential Ingredients for Beautiful – and Responsible – Living Bathrooms.</p>
<p>
	Duravit has Worked with Designer Christian Werner to Design a Furniture Series that Represents Airiness, Freshness and Joie De Vivre in Today’s Bathroom.The Range stands out with Its Precise, Finely Nuanced Geometry which is Produced by Slender Cabinet Frames that Form the Edges of the Furniture, Mirrors, and Mirror Cabinets.</p>

<strong>Duravit KT733100000 Ketho 31-1/2 x 29-1/2 Inch Mirror with Lighting</strong></p>
<p>
	As modern life places greater demands upon us, we, in turn, also start to demand more. These demands also extend to the bathroom, which we expect to be attractive, inviting and also functional. Ketho takes this development into account: designed by Christian Werner, the new range of bathroom furniture is characterised by clear forms, well thought-out functionality and comfortable quality. The characteristic, ergonomic handles feature throughout the range and give Ketho its true originality. The reduced look of the range is fl exible enough to suit any modern bathroom ambience. Combined with good value for money, Ketho becomes the ideal range for first-time buyers.</p>

With fewer “distractions”, the bathroom user is inspired to truly relax and unwind. The geometry of the sleek, rectangular furniture fronts remain uninterrupted by hardware.

	The simple, natural, fundamental elements of life. With his Starck 1 range, he achieved just that… and almost immediately wrote bathroom history. With Starck 1, Philippe Starck and Duravit have returned to the beginnings of hygiene, body care and wellness in addition to the evolution of the bathroom. The Starck 1 toilet, bathtub and washbasin are unmistakable descendents of their historic predecessors – the bucket, tub and washbowl – even though they have been completely reinterpreted. It’s great to know that something good doesn’t have to be “optimized”: since their market launch in 1994, all products in the range – ceramic, furniture, tubs, accessories – have been meticulously crafted by hand using the same methods. This quality is nothing less than you would expect from a modern classic like Starck 1.
	Another wonder creation from designer Philipe Starck, this mirror is sure to stun and please. Duravits fascinating fixture is the latest style statement in both classic and modern households. Loaded with latest hi-tech features the mirror is quite user-friendly and provides the much-needed refreshing ambience in your bathroom. Provided with sensor switch and complete with LED light, this IP44 rated mirror is a must-buy.
	The elegant, skilfully designed mirror (43 1/2"" x 30 1/8""), integrates perfectly within the range. The all-round LED lighting creates perfect illumination and a pleasant lighting atmosphere in the bathroom.

In 1956, production evolved from earthenware to porcelain, extending the product range to include sanitary ceramics. This provided a platform for future success and also introduced the sanitary world to a new name: Duravit. Today, Duravit AG operates at an international level and boasts 10 production plants with a workforce of more than 5,000 employees worldwide."
