Of course, good design isn’t everything, but all the same a welldesigned object makes life more pleasant. All the more so if it is affordable. D-Code from Duravit is a new kind of bathroom range – complete from washbasin to towel rail, consistently designed throughout and excellent value for money. Its appearance is restrained, featuring rectangular forms with rounded edges – the classic washbasin shape, in fact, that does not impose itself but rather blends with its surroundings. This is what makes D-Code so timelessly modern – a hallmark of good design. With alternatives and solutions for all imaginable bathroom situations, D-Code is a bathroom range that many people have been waiting for – including you perhaps.

A true Starck, but less elaborate: this was the inspiration behind the second Duravit – Philippe Starck collaboration. The result: Starck 2, a range of ceramics that is the ultimate successor to its famous predecessor, Starck 1. Starck 2 also derives its inspiration from the origins of bathroom design: the ceramic forms embody the flowing movement of water and allow us to see the bathroom through a new set of eyes. Starck 2 – the bathroom as a source.

<span id=""ctl00_cphBodyContainer_rZoneProducts_Body_Bot1_ctl06_rRule_ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_lblMarketingCopy"">A true Starck, but less elaborate: this was the inspiration behind the second Duravit – Philippe Starck collaboration. The result: Starck 2, a range of ceramics that is the ultimate successor to its famous predecessor, Starck 1. Starck 2 also derives its inspiration from the origins of bathroom design: the ceramic forms embody the flowing movement of water and allow us to see the bathroom through a new set of eyes. Starck 2 – the bathroom as a source.</span></div>
