Frequently copied but never matched. The Starck 3 range is and remains the measure of all things when it comes to design, variety and price. Even more top-quality Starck at a great value: there’s no doubt that, with the Starck 3 range of ceramics, Duravit has revolutionized the sanitary world. Starck 3 brings design to a segment where it was once an untouched concept with a vast array of products that meet all needs and tastes. And – the range provides better value for money than ever before. With more than 50 models and 64 variants, Starck 3 is one of Duravit’s most extensive bathroom ranges. So, it only seems right that a range that offers so much requires its own brochure to illustrate its numerous applications, examples, and references.

The Starck 3 range is and remains the measure of all things when it comes to design, variety and price. Even more top-quality Starck at a great value: there’s no doubt that, with the Starck 3 range of ceramics, Duravit has revolutionized the sanitary world. Starck 3 brings design to a segment where it was once an untouched concept with a vast array of products that meet all needs and tastes. And – the range provides better value for money than ever before. With more than 50 models and 64 variants, Starck 3 is one of Duravit’s most extensive bathroom ranges. So, it only seems right that a range that offers so much requires its own brochure to illustrate its numerous applications, examples, and references. </span></div>

	Duravit has been the Proud Recipient of numerous international design awards.These awards celebrate bold design, which has become Duravit’s hallmark over the years.Each Duravit designer is a specialist in his field – a prominent global innovator with an inherent sense for good design. Good design, as Duravit and its designers see it, is never at the expense of practicality – neither is interested in “design for design’s sake”.That’s you, the bathroom user, and your own set of needs and requirements. Thanks to an ongoing dialogue with its trade partners and sanitary ware dealers, Duravit is best able to address these needs and requirements in the brand’s designs. Simply put, Duravit recognizes good bathroom design by the fact that it seems specially-created to suit all individual tastes.This fusion of Duravit’s environmentally-friendly production technologies with the company’s meticulous quality control results in products that are highly functional and long-lasting.At Duravit, sustainable materials, modern expertise and the foresight to recognize what will be important tomorrow comprise the essential ingredients for beautiful – and responsible – living bathrooms.

	However, individuality does not mean making an impression with all means. Simply an ambiance which reflects itself, gives your personality air to breathe and space to do your own thing. Such as DuraStyle: Designed by Matteo Thun & Partners, the range of bathrooms is revealed as deliberately discreet – and blends harmoniously into practically any ambiance for this very same reason.
	The innovative impression given continues within the design of toilet and bidet: The flat seat & cover, available with and without a soft-close system, is eye-catching. Wall-mounted and freestanding toilets can also be combined with the shower-toilet seat SensoWash® DuraStyle by Starck. Ceramics and seat blend into a harmonious, elegant unit.The open design of the flushing rim enables an innovative water flow. Thanks to modern 4.5-l technology, perfect flushing results are guaranteed, even with only a small amount of water. Due to its open and easily accessible rim area, it is also considerably easier to keep the bowl clean.

Good design, as Duravit and its designers see it, is never at the expense of practicality – neither is interested in “design for design’s sake”.That’s you, the bathroom user, and your own set of needs and requirements. Thanks to an ongoing dialogue with its trade partners and sanitary ware dealers, Duravit is best able to address these needs and requirements in the brand’s designs. Simply put, Duravit recognizes good bathroom design by the fact that it seems specially-created to suit all individual tastes.This fusion of Duravit’s environmentally-friendly production technologies with the company’s meticulous quality control results in products that are highly functional and long-lasting.At Duravit, sustainable materials, modern expertise and the foresight to recognize what will be important tomorrow comprise the essential ingredients for beautiful – and responsible – living bathrooms.</p>
<p>
	However, individuality does not mean making an impression with all means. Simply an ambiance which reflects itself, gives your personality air to breathe and space to do your own thing. Such as DuraStyle: Designed by Matteo Thun &amp; Partners, the range of bathrooms is revealed as deliberately discreet – and blends harmoniously into practically any ambiance for this very same reason.</p>
<p>
	The innovative impression given continues within the design of toilet and bidet: The flat seat &amp; cover, available with and without a soft-close system, is eye-catching. Wall-mounted and freestanding toilets can also be combined with the shower-toilet seat SensoWash® DuraStyle by Starck. Ceramics and seat blend into a harmonious, elegant unit.The open design of the flushing rim enables an innovative water flow. Thanks to modern 4.5-l technology, perfect flushing results are guaranteed, even with only a small amount of water. Due to its open and easily accessible rim area, it is also considerably easier to keep the bowl clean.</p>

Thanks to the Open, Easily Accessible Rim Area, the Bowl is Particularly Easy to Keep Clean, and This Reduces Cleaning Times Considerably.The Innovative Ceramic Glaze is Antibacterial: It Effectively Kills Bacteria and Germs. Hygieneglaze is Not a Surface Coating. It is Integrated Into the Ceramic Glaze and Then Baked Into the Ceramic During Firing, Providing Continuous Protection with Long-Lasting Effectiveness. Tests by the Institute for Hygiene and Public Health at the University of Bonn Confirm that Hygieneglaze Kills an Almost Unprecedented 99.9 % of Germs. Antibacterial, Durable, Safe: with Hygieneglaze Duravit Defines a New Standard in Bathroom Hygiene. Hygieneglaze is Optionally Available for the Toilets and Urinals in the P3 Comforts and Me by Starck Collections.</p>

	Duravit has been the Proud Recipient of Numerous International Design Awards.These Awards Celebrate Bold Design, which has Become Duravit’s Hallmark over the Years.Each Duravit Designer is a Specialist in His Field – a Prominent Global Innovator with an Inherent Sense for Good Design. Good Design, as Duravit and Its Designers See It, is never at the Expense of Practicality – Neither is Interested in “Design for Design’s Sake”.That’s You, the Bathroom User, and Your Own Set of Needs and Requirements. Thanks to an Ongoing Dialogue with Its Trade Partners and Sanitary Ware Dealers, Duravit is Best Able to Address these Needs and Requirements in the Brand’s Designs.

D-Code. The key to elegance in the bathroom. Of course, good design isn’t everything, but all the same a welldesigned object makes life more pleasant. All the more so if it is affordable. D-Code from Duravit is a new kind of bathroom range – complete from washbasin to towel rail, consistently designed throughout and excellent value for money. Its appearance is restrained, featuring rectangular forms with rounded edges – the classic washbasin shape, in fact, that does not impose itself but rather blends with its surroundings. This is what makes D-Code so timelessly modern – a hallmark of good design. With alternatives and solutions for all imaginable bathroom situations, D-Code is a bathroom range that many people have been waiting for – including you perhaps.

	However, Individuality does Not Mean Making an Impression with All Means. Simply an Ambiance which Reflects Itself, Gives Your Personality Air to Breathe and Space to do Your Own Thing. Such as Durastyle: Designed by Matteo Thun & Partners, the Range of Bathrooms is Revealed as Deliberately Discreet – and Blends Harmoniously Into Practically Any Ambiance for This Very Same Reason.
	The Innovative Impression Given Continues Within the Design of Toilet and Bidet: the Flat Seat & Cover, Available with and Without a Soft-Close System, is Eye-Catching. Wall-Mounted and Freestanding Toilets can also be Combined with the Shower-Toilet Seat Sensowash Durastyle by Starck. Ceramics and Seat Blend Into a Harmonious, Elegant Unit.The Open Design of the Flushing Rim Enables an Innovative Water Flow. Thanks to Modern 4.5-L Technology, Perfect Flushing Results are Guaranteed, even with Only a Small Amount of Water. Due to Its Open and Easily Accessible Rim Area, It is also Considerably Easier to Keep the Bowl Clean.

	Duravit has been the Proud Recipient of Numerous International Design Awards.These Awards Celebrate Bold Design, which has Become Duravit’s Hallmark over the Years.Each Duravit Designer is a Specialist in His Field – a Prominent Global Innovator with an Inherent Sense for Good Design. Good Design, as Duravit and Its Designers See It, is never at the Expense of Practicality – Neither is Interested in “Design for Design’s Sake”.That’s You, the Bathroom User, and Your Own Set of Needs and Requirements. Thanks to an Ongoing Dialogue with Its Trade Partners and Sanitary Ware Dealers, Duravit is Best Able to Address these Needs and Requirements in the Brand’s Designs. Simply Put, Duravit Recognizes Good Bathroom Design by the Fact that It Seems Specially-Created to Suit All Individual Tastes.This Fusion of Duravit’s Environmentally-Friendly Production Technologies with the Company’s Meticulous Quality Control Results in Products that are Highly Functional and Long-Lasting.At Duravit, Sustainable Materials, Modern Expertise and the Foresight to Recognize What Will be Important Tomorrow Comprise the Essential Ingredients for Beautiful – and Responsible – Living Bathrooms.
	However, Individuality does Not Mean Making an Impression with All Means. Simply an Ambiance which Reflects Itself, Gives Your Personality Air to Breathe and Space to do Your Own Thing. Such as Durastyle: Designed by Matteo Thun & Partners, the Range of Bathrooms is Revealed as Deliberately Discreet – and Blends Harmoniously Into Practically Any Ambiance for This Very Same Reason.
	The Innovative Impression Given Continues Within the Design of Toilet and Bidet: the Flat Seat & Cover, Available with and Without a Soft-Close System, is Eye-Catching. Wall-Mounted and Freestanding Toilets can also be Combined with the Shower-Toilet Seat Sensowash Durastyle by Starck. Ceramics and Seat Blend Into a Harmonious, Elegant Unit.The Open Design of the Flushing Rim Enables an Innovative Water Flow. Thanks to Modern 4.5-L Technology, Perfect Flushing Results are Guaranteed, even with Only a Small Amount of Water. Due to Its Open and Easily Accessible Rim Area, It is also Considerably Easier to Keep the Bowl Clean.

Even more top-quality Starck at a great value: there’s no doubt that, with the Starck 3 range of ceramics, Duravit has revolutionized the sanitary world. Starck 3 brings design to a segment where it was once an untouched concept with a vast array of products that meet all needs and tastes. And – the range provides better value for money than ever before. With more than 50 models and 64 variants, Starck 3 is one of Duravit’s most extensive bathroom ranges. So, it only seems right that a range that offers so much requires its own brochure to illustrate its numerous applications, examples, and references.

	Duravit has been the Proud Recipient of Numerous International Design Awards.These Awards Celebrate Bold Design, which has Become Duravit’s Hallmark over the Years.Each Duravit Designer is a Specialist in His Field – a Prominent Global Innovator with an Inherent Sense for Good Design.

Frequently copied but never matched. The Starck 3 range is and remains the measure of all things when it comes to design, variety and price. Even more top-quality Starck at a great value: there’s no doubt that, with the Starck 3 range of ceramics, Duravit has revolutionized the sanitary world. Starck 3 brings design to a segment where it was once an untouched concept with a vast array of products that meet all needs and tastes. And – the range provides better value for money than ever before. With more than 50 models and 64 variants, Starck 3 is one of Duravit’s most extensive bathroom ranges. So, it only seems right that a range that offers so much requires its own brochure to illustrate its numerous applications, examples, and references.

Even more top-quality Starck at a great value: there’s no doubt that, with the Starck 3 range of ceramics, Duravit has revolutionized the sanitary world. Starck 3 brings design to a segment where it was once an untouched concept with a vast array of products that meet all needs and tastes. And – the range provides better value for money than ever before. With more than 50 models and 64 variants, Starck 3 is one of Duravit’s most extensive bathroom ranges. So, it only seems right that a range that offers so much requires its own brochure to illustrate its numerous applications, examples, and references.</span></div>

	Duravit has been the Proud Recipient of Numerous International Design Awards.These Awards Celebrate Bold Design, which has Become Duravit’s Hallmark over the Years.Each Duravit Designer is a Specialist in His Field – a Prominent Global Innovator with an Inherent Sense for Good Design. Good Design, as Duravit and Its Designers See It, is never at the Expense of Practicality – Neither is Interested in “Design for Design’s Sake”.That’s You, the Bathroom User, and Your Own Set of Needs and Requirements. Thanks to an Ongoing Dialogue with Its Trade Partners and Sanitary Ware Dealers, Duravit is Best Able to Address these Needs and Requirements in the Brand’s Designs.

Such as Durastyle: Designed by Matteo Thun & Partners, the Range of Bathrooms is Revealed as Deliberately Discreet – and Blends Harmoniously Into Practically Any Ambiance for This Very Same Reason.
	The Innovative Impression Given Continues Within the Design of Toilet and Bidet: the Flat Seat & Cover, Available with and Without a Soft-Close System, is Eye-Catching. Wall-Mounted and Freestanding Toilets can also be Combined with the Shower-Toilet Seat Sensowash Durastyle by Starck. Ceramics and Seat Blend Into a Harmonious, Elegant Unit.The Open Design of the Flushing Rim Enables an Innovative Water Flow. Thanks to Modern 4.5-L Technology, Perfect Flushing Results are Guaranteed, even with Only a Small Amount of Water.

	However, Individuality does Not Mean Making an Impression with All Means. Simply an Ambiance which Reflects Itself, Gives Your Personality Air to Breathe and Space to do Your Own Thing. Such as Durastyle: Designed by Matteo Thun & Partners, the Range of Bathrooms is Revealed as Deliberately Discreet – and Blends Harmoniously Into Practically Any Ambiance for This Very Same Reason.
	The Innovative Impression Given Continues Within the Design of Toilet and Bidet: the Flat Seat & Cover, Available with and Without a Soft-Close System, is Eye-Catching. Wall-Mounted and Freestanding Toilets can also be Combined with the Shower-Toilet Seat Sensowash Durastyle by Starck. Ceramics and Seat Blend Into a Harmonious, Elegant Unit.The Open Design of the Flushing Rim Enables an Innovative Water Flow. Thanks to Modern 4.5-L Technology, Perfect Flushing Results are Guaranteed, even with Only a Small Amount of Water. Due to Its Open and Easily Accessible Rim Area, It is also Considerably Easier to Keep the Bowl Clean.

The compact wall-mounted toilets and bidets offer a practical solution for smaller rooms: with a projection of just 19 1/8"" (485 mm), it saves valuable space in the bathroom.

	Duravit has been the Proud Recipient of numerous international design awards.These awards celebrate bold design, which has become Duravit’s hallmark over the years.Each Duravit designer is a specialist in his field – a prominent global innovator with an inherent sense for good design. Good design, as Duravit and its designers see it, is never at the expense of practicality – neither is interested in “design for design’s sake”.That’s you, the bathroom user, and your own set of needs and requirements. Thanks to an ongoing dialogue with its trade partners and sanitary ware dealers, Duravit is best able to address these needs and requirements in the brand’s designs. Simply put, Duravit recognizes good bathroom design by the fact that it seems specially-created to suit all individual tastes.This fusion of Duravit’s environmentally-friendly production technologies with the company’s meticulous quality control results in products that are highly functional and long-lasting.At Duravit, sustainable materials, modern expertise and the foresight to recognize what will be important tomorrow comprise the essential ingredients for beautiful – and responsible – living bathrooms.
	Even more top-quality Starck at a great value: there’s no doubt that, with the Starck 3 range of ceramics, Duravit has revolutionized the sanitary world. Starck 3 brings design to a segment where it was once an untouched concept with a vast array of products that meet all needs and tastes. And – the range provides better value for money than ever before.
	The toilet is an essential part of every bathroom. Reason enough for Philippe Starck to dedicate just as much care to its design as to any other item in the range.The wall-mounted toilet that is closed at the side becomes a distinctive highlight.The toilet is available in various wall-mounted and floor standing versions and also in combination with the SensoWash® Starck shower-toilet seat.
	 Like all Duravit toilets, it features a glazed and thus easy-care flushing rim, as well as a single and dual flush function (1.6 / 0.8 gpf).The compact wall-mounted toilets and bidets offer a practical solution for smaller rooms: with a projection of just 19 1/8"" (485 mm), it saves valuable space in the bathroom.
Features:
		Covered under Duravit's 5 year warranty
		Coordinates with products from the Starck 3 line seamlessly
		One-piece configuration provides a uniform look and simplifies installation
		Installs in a floor mounted configuration
		Left hand trip lever placement
		Constructed of ceramic ensuring dependability and durability
		Concealed trapway - provides a smoother and less utilitarian appearance, a built in skirt hides the discharge passageway from view
		Toilet Seat included with this product
		WaterSense certified - toilet uses 20% less water than the current standard while maintaining superior performance
Specifications:
		Overall Height: 26-3/8"" (from bottom of the base to the highest point of the toilet)

	However, individuality does not mean making an impression with all means. Simply an ambiance which reflects itself, gives your personality air to breathe and space to do your own thing. Such as DuraStyle: Designed by Matteo Thun & Partners, the range of bathrooms is revealed as deliberately discreet – and blends harmoniously into practically any ambiance for this very same reason.
	The innovative impression given continues within the design of toilet and bidet: The flat seat & cover, available with and without a soft-close system, is eye-catching. Wall-mounted and freestanding toilets can also be combined with the shower-toilet seat SensoWash® DuraStyle by Starck. Ceramics and seat blend into a harmonious, elegant unit.The open design of the flushing rim enables an innovative water flow. Thanks to modern 4.5-l technology, perfect flushing results are guaranteed, even with only a small amount of water. Due to its open and easily accessible rim area, it is also considerably easier to keep the bowl clean.
Collection Highlights:
		Simple, yet formal design
		Design by Matteo Thun & Partners
		Price-conscious, versatile, perfect for any taste
		Narrow bathtub rim with distinctive edge
		Comfortable basin depth
		Furniture solutions with a distinct lightness
		A mix of open and closed fronts
		Exciting combinations: light and dark decor wood tones
		Doors and drawers without handles
		Rimless toilet with easy-care rim and hygienic flush
		Super-flat toilet seats
		Bathtub with sleek, practical rim
Features:
		Covered under Duravit's 5 year warranty
		Coordinates with products from the DuraStyle line seamlessly
		Two-piece configuration allows for easier access to the area around the toilet
		Installs in a floor mounted configuration
		Top of tank push button flush
		Constructed of ceramic ensuring dependability and durability
		Concealed trapway - provides a smoother and less utilitarian appearance, a built in skirt hides the discharge passageway from view

These awards celebrate bold design, which has become Duravit’s hallmark over the years.Each Duravit designer is a specialist in his field – a prominent global innovator with an inherent sense for good design. Good design, as Duravit and its designers see it, is never at the expense of practicality – neither is interested in “design for design’s sake”.That’s you, the bathroom user, and your own set of needs and requirements. Thanks to an ongoing dialogue with its trade partners and sanitary ware dealers, Duravit is best able to address these needs and requirements in the brand’s designs. Simply put, Duravit recognizes good bathroom design by the fact that it seems specially-created to suit all individual tastes.This fusion of Duravit’s environmentally-friendly production technologies with the company’s meticulous quality control results in products that are highly functional and long-lasting.At Duravit, sustainable materials, modern expertise and the foresight to recognize what will be important tomorrow comprise the essential ingredients for beautiful – and responsible – living bathrooms.
	However, individuality does not mean making an impression with all means. Simply an ambiance which reflects itself, gives your personality air to breathe and space to do your own thing. Such as DuraStyle: Designed by Matteo Thun & Partners, the range of bathrooms is revealed as deliberately discreet – and blends harmoniously into practically any ambiance for this very same reason.
	The innovative impression given continues within the design of toilet and bidet: The flat seat & cover, available with and without a soft-close system, is eye-catching. Wall-mounted and freestanding toilets can also be combined with the shower-toilet seat SensoWash® DuraStyle by Starck. Ceramics and seat blend into a harmonious, elegant unit.The open design of the flushing rim enables an innovative water flow. Thanks to modern 4.5-l technology, perfect flushing results are guaranteed, even with only a small amount of water. Due to its open and easily accessible rim area, it is also considerably easier to keep the bowl clean.

Good design, as Duravit and its designers see it, is never at the expense of practicality – neither is interested in “design for design’s sake”.That’s you, the bathroom user, and your own set of needs and requirements. Thanks to an ongoing dialogue with its trade partners and sanitary ware dealers, Duravit is best able to address these needs and requirements in the brand’s designs. Simply put, Duravit recognizes good bathroom design by the fact that it seems specially-created to suit all individual tastes.This fusion of Duravit’s environmentally-friendly production technologies with the company’s meticulous quality control results in products that are highly functional and long-lasting.At Duravit, sustainable materials, modern expertise and the foresight to recognize what will be important tomorrow comprise the essential ingredients for beautiful – and responsible – living bathrooms.
	However, individuality does not mean making an impression with all means. Simply an ambiance which reflects itself, gives your personality air to breathe and space to do your own thing. Such as DuraStyle: Designed by Matteo Thun & Partners, the range of bathrooms is revealed as deliberately discreet – and blends harmoniously into practically any ambiance for this very same reason.
	The innovative impression given continues within the design of toilet and bidet: The flat seat & cover, available with and without a soft-close system, is eye-catching. Wall-mounted and freestanding toilets can also be combined with the shower-toilet seat SensoWash® DuraStyle by Starck. Ceramics and seat blend into a harmonious, elegant unit.The open design of the flushing rim enables an innovative water flow. Thanks to modern 4.5-l technology, perfect flushing results are guaranteed, even with only a small amount of water. Due to its open and easily accessible rim area, it is also considerably easier to keep the bowl clean.

	Duravit has been the proud recipient of numerous international design awards. These awards celebrate bold design, which has become Duravit’s hallmark over the years.Each Duravit designer is a specialist in his field – a prominent global innovator with an inherent sense for good design. Good design, as Duravit and its designers see it, is never at the expense of practicality – neither is interested in “design for design’s sake”.That’s you, the bathroom user, and your own set of needs and requirements. Thanks to an ongoing dialogue with its trade partners and sanitary ware dealers, Duravit is best able to address these needs and requirements in the brand’s designs. Simply put, Duravit recognizes good bathroom design by the fact that it seems specially-created to suit all individual tastes.This fusion of Duravit’s environmentally-friendly production technologies with the company’s meticulous quality control results in products that are highly functional and long-lasting.At Duravit, sustainable materials, modern expertise and the foresight to recognize what will be important tomorrow comprise the essential ingredients for beautiful – and responsible – living bathrooms.</p>
<p>
	Happy D.2 is a complete bathroom solution that is just as chic, versatile and timelessly modern as its predecessor – and yet it’s also completely new. Because the series presents itself from a feminine side: this is achieved thanks to the fine radii of the rounded corners that feature throughout the bathroom program – and that give Happy D.2 its distinctive, archetypal design. No<br/>
	doubt about it, Happy D.2 brings a new elegance into the bathroom.</p>
<p>
	Form and utility: toilets and bidets are available as wall-mounted, floor standing and back-to-wall options, both with and without the SoftClose seat function. The toilets can also be combined with the SensoWash® Starck shower-toilet seat.</p>

	Duravit has been the proud recipient of numerous international design awards. These awards celebrate bold design, which has become Duravit’s hallmark over the years.Each Duravit designer is a specialist in his field – a prominent global innovator with an inherent sense for good design. Good design, as Duravit and its designers see it, is never at the expense of practicality – neither is interested in “design for design’s sake”.That’s you, the bathroom user, and your own set of needs and requirements. Thanks to an ongoing dialogue with its trade partners and sanitary ware dealers, Duravit is best able to address these needs and requirements in the brand’s designs. Simply put, Duravit recognizes good bathroom design by the fact that it seems specially-created to suit all individual tastes.This fusion of Duravit’s environmentally-friendly production technologies with the company’s meticulous quality control results in products that are highly functional and long-lasting.At Duravit, sustainable materials, modern expertise and the foresight to recognize what will be important tomorrow comprise the essential ingredients for beautiful – and responsible – living bathrooms.
	Perfectly designed forms that are neither intrusive nor dominating, therefore leaving ample room for both individuality and design. Products that appear perfectly proportioned from every angle and can simultaneously fulfill individual ideas. ME by Starck is the result and the framework for your own personal style, whether it be pure, elegant, natural, or completely individualistic.

	Not only in its literal sense, but also in terms of the French word “conforter” – to strengthen. As design satisfies very fundamental human requirements for appearance and functionality, it also demands to be experienced by all the senses. It is to be seen, touched and used - to address and build the user's emotions and personality. P3 Comforts satisfies these needs, and does so with a clean and effortless design.
	The generous width of the toilet provides 3/4"" of additional seating comfort, while its design harmonizes seamlessly with matching P3 Comforts washbasins. The DuraFix installation system for the wall-mounted toilets enhances this smooth, unified look. The innovative water flow provided by Duravit Rimless® toilet flushing technology ensures outstanding flushing results, even when using only a small volume of water. An open and easily accessible rim area allows for easier cleaning. For even greater comfort and hygiene, the toilet can also be fitted with the SensoWash® Slim shower-toilet seat.The P3 Comforts toilets are available in many variations. Generous: + 3/4"" in width provide even more seating comfort.Nearly all of the toilets can be optionally fitted with the SensoWash® Slim shower-toilet seat, which offers optimal comfort and hygiene. The seat is operated via remote control, which features all basic functions at a glance – comfort wash, lady wash, rear wash, and water temperature and spray nozzle adjustment. As with the standard toilets, the soft closure is integrated into SensoWash® Slim.

	Duravit has been the proud recipient of numerous international design awards. These awards celebrate bold design, which has become Duravit’s hallmark over the years.Each Duravit designer is a specialist in his field – a prominent global innovator with an inherent sense for good design. Good design, as Duravit and its designers see it, is never at the expense of practicality – neither is interested in “design for design’s sake”.That’s you, the bathroom user, and your own set of needs and requirements. Thanks to an ongoing dialogue with its trade partners and sanitary ware dealers, Duravit is best able to address these needs and requirements in the brand’s designs. Simply put, Duravit recognizes good bathroom design by the fact that it seems specially-created to suit all individual tastes.This fusion of Duravit’s environmentally-friendly production technologies with the company’s meticulous quality control results in products that are highly functional and long-lasting.At Duravit, sustainable materials, modern expertise and the foresight to recognize what will be important tomorrow comprise the essential ingredients for beautiful – and responsible – living bathrooms.
	Not without reason is the Vero ceramic series a modern design classic that has now been a Duravit bestseller for more than a decade: its consistently rectangular design is not only elegant but also timeless. With the new bathroom furniture collection, Vero has been promoted to a complete bathroom.
