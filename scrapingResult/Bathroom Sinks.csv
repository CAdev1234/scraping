	Not only in its literal sense, but also in terms of the French word “conforter” – to strengthen. As design satisfies very fundamental human requirements for appearance and functionality, it also demands to be experienced by all the senses. It is to be seen, touched and used - to address and build the user's emotions and personality. P3 Comforts satisfies these needs, and does so with a clean and effortless design.
		One of the distinguishing design features of the P3 Comforts washbasin is the tap platform. It separates the wet and dry areas and creates a platform to accommodate faucets, as well as a generous surface area for bathroom essentials. The narrow washbasin rim creates an air of lightness and elegance.

As design satisfies very fundamental human requirements for appearance and functionality, it also demands to be experienced by all the senses.

	Cape Cod, located in New England off the coast of the US, features an unforgettable flair. The region, known for its beaches stretching for miles, crystal clear water and untamed nature, is the inspiration for Cape Cod, the new bathroom series by Philippe Starck and Duravit.
	Cape Cod eliminates all barriers between the in- and outdoors, making nature a permanent component of the bathroom, with organic forms and authentic materials such as solid real wood and warm ceramics. With Cape Cod, Starck and Duravit have reinvented the bathroom as a place of rejuvenation for the mind, body and soul. Cape Cod combines originality of design with timeless modernity by offering a sleek, thin ceramic washbowl rim, an impressive mixture of furniture materials and an organically shaped bathtub.
There has never been a washbowl quite like Cape Cod... Attractive in its high grade porcelain finish, it features elegant, fine edges that measure only 1/4"" in thickness. Made possible by the innovative DuraCeram material, its result provides outstanding elegance without compromising quality, robustness or ease of care.

	Cape Cod, located in New England off the coast of the US, features an unforgettable flair. The region, known for its beaches stretching for miles, crystal clear water and untamed nature, is the inspiration for Cape Cod, the new bathroom series by Philippe Starck and Duravit.
	Cape Cod eliminates all barriers between the in- and outdoors, making nature a permanent component of the bathroom, with organic forms and authentic materials such as solid real wood and warm ceramics. With Cape Cod, Starck and Duravit have reinvented the bathroom as a place of rejuvenation for the mind, body and soul. Cape Cod combines originality of design with timeless modernity by offering a sleek, thin ceramic washbowl rim, an impressive mixture of furniture materials and an organically shaped bathtub.
There has never been a washbowl quite like Cape Cod... Attractive in its high grade porcelain finish, it features elegant, fine edges that measure only 1/4"" in thickness. Made possible by the innovative DuraCeram material, its result provides outstanding elegance without compromising quality, robustness or ease of care.
Sanitary ceramics with the special WonderGliss surface finish will remain clean and attractive-looking for a long time to come

	Duravit has been the Proud Recipient of numerous international design awards.These awards celebrate bold design, which has become Duravit’s hallmark over the years.Each Duravit designer is a specialist in his field – a prominent global innovator with an inherent sense for good design. Good design, as Duravit and its designers see it, is never at the expense of practicality – neither is interested in “design for design’s sake”.That’s you, the bathroom user, and your own set of needs and requirements. Thanks to an ongoing dialogue with its trade partners and sanitary ware dealers, Duravit is best able to address these needs and requirements in the brand’s designs. Simply put, Duravit recognizes good bathroom design by the fact that it seems specially-created to suit all individual tastes.This fusion of Duravit’s environmentally-friendly production technologies with the company’s meticulous quality control results in products that are highly functional and long-lasting.At Duravit, sustainable materials, modern expertise and the foresight to recognize what will be important tomorrow comprise the essential ingredients for beautiful – and responsible – living bathrooms.
	New interpretation of timeless geometry: the consistently rectangular design language of the Vero bathroom range from 2001 is one of the classics in the Duravit program. And now it's time for Vero Air: Thanks to today's technical options, Vero Air is a complete bathroom collection that combines the unmistakable character of the original with a new level of precision and perfect proportions.
	The Vero Air washbasins boast streamlined surfaces, small and exact radii, optimized proportions and narrow edges. Slim, precise, completely streamlined.The Vero washbasins have been touched up and refined to create Vero Air.The new features include the slight lowering of the rear rim of the inside basin and the repositioning of the outlet.

		The WonderGliss coating that is baked into the ceramic doesn‘t give grime a chance: dirt and limescale cannot secure a hold on the smooth surface, so residue runs off more easily with the water. Sanitary ceramics featuring WonderGliss stay smooth and clean for longer and are thus extremely easy to clean. All it takes is a soft cloth and mild cleaning agent.

	Striking. Precise. Rectangular. And yet soft and flowing.The DuraSquare ceramics effortlessly bring together apparent contradictions whilst also looking incredibly good. Clarity, precision and minimalism run through the entire program, which is not only modern and timeless but also sustainable and durable.
	The washbasins feature extremely precise, parallel lines that, inside the basin, make way for soft and round transitions. Made from the innovative material DuraCeram®, precise rims can be created that are just a quarter inch thick. This maximizes the size of the basin, which is also particularly easy to clean.The fusion of rectangle and circle.The above-counter basin is also available with a glazed back and all-round rim and can therefore be positioned directly in front of a mirror.Also suitable for smaller rooms: the subtle shapes of the ceramic and console of the handrinse basin create particular transparency and lightness.

	Duravit has been the Proud Recipient of Numerous International Design Awards.These Awards Celebrate Bold Design, which has Become Duravit’s Hallmark over the Years.Each Duravit Designer is a Specialist in His Field – a Prominent Global Innovator with an Inherent Sense for Good Design. Good Design, as Duravit and Its Designers See It, is never at the Expense of Practicality – Neither is Interested in “Design for Design’s Sake”.That’s You, the Bathroom User, and Your Own Set of Needs and Requirements. Thanks to an Ongoing Dialogue with Its Trade Partners and Sanitary Ware Dealers, Duravit is Best Able to Address these Needs and Requirements in the Brand’s Designs. Simply Put, Duravit Recognizes Good Bathroom Design by the Fact that It Seems Specially-Created to Suit All Individual Tastes.This Fusion of Duravit’s Environmentally-Friendly Production Technologies with the Company’s Meticulous Quality Control Results in Products that are Highly Functional and Long-Lasting.At Duravit, Sustainable Materials, Modern Expertise and the Foresight to Recognize What Will be Important Tomorrow Comprise the Essential Ingredients for Beautiful – and Responsible – Living Bathrooms.</p>
<p>
	The Unusual Design of the Luv Series, Designed by Cecilie Manz, Combines Nordic Minimalism with Timeless Elegance. Gentle Forms Follow a Stringent Geometry. Luv is Defined by Precise, Clear and Fine Forms and Edges.The Designer's Original Vision for This Range Was a Bowl Filled with Water on a Table.The Result is a New Design Language That, Both Minimalist and Elegant, can be Interpreted in a Highly Individual Manner.</p>

In 1956, production evolved from earthenware to porcelain, extending the product range to include sanitary ceramics. This provided a platform for future success and also introduced the sanitary world to a new name: Duravit. Today, Duravit AG operates at an international level and boasts 10 production plants with a workforce of more than 5,000 employees worldwide."

In 1956, production evolved from earthenware to porcelain, extending the product range to include sanitary ceramics. This provided a platform for future success and also introduced the sanitary world to a new name: Duravit. Today, Duravit AG operates at an international level and boasts 10 production plants with a workforce of more than 5,000 employees worldwide."

all began in Hornberg, Germany in 1817 when Georg Friedrich Horn built an earthenware factory initially focused solely on the manufacture of crockery. In 1956, production evolved from earthenware to porcelain, extending the product range to include sanitary ceramics. This provided a platform for future success and also introduced the sanitary world to a new name: Duravit. Today, Duravit AG operates at an international level and boasts 10 production plants with a workforce of more than 5,000 employees worldwide."

In 1956, production evolved from earthenware to porcelain, extending the product range to include sanitary ceramics. This provided a platform for future success and also introduced the sanitary world to a new name: Duravit. Today, Duravit AG operates at an international level and boasts 10 production plants with a workforce of more than 5,000 employees worldwide."
