	OpenSpace is the shower enclosure that amplifies the bathroom instead of taking up valuable space, it can simply be folded back against the wall after each use. Duravit and the EOOS design group have taken this innovative idea to the next level with OpenSpace B, which opens up even more possibilities. Thanks to a new mounting bracket, no additional diagonal wall support is required, even in larger applications.
	Even more possibilities. Thanks to a new mounting bracket. No additional diagonal wall support is required, even in larger applications. Clear glass, mirrored glass and bright polished aluminum come together to create a harmonious unit. The new OpenSpace accessories, which include a seat, handle and basket, provide additional comfort. OpenSpace B is available in four sizes and 16 variants and provides great value for money. The simple, consistent door panel closes perfectly thanks to its magnetic straps. The shower doors are available in a clear glass finish, while the partition concealing the faucets is also available in a mirrored version. Thanks to a stable new OpenSpace B mounting bracket, no additional elements interfere with the uniform look of the wall materials.
